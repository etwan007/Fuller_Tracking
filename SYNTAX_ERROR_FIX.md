# Fix Applied: TaskTable.jsx Syntax Error

## Problem
The Vite development server was showing:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/src/components/TaskTable.jsx?t=1749786442302 net::ERR_ABORTED 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## Root Cause
There was a syntax error in `TaskTable.jsx` where a `try {` block was missing before a fetch call, causing the JavaScript parser to fail and resulting in a 500 error when Vite tried to process the file.

## Fix Applied
Fixed the broken try-catch structure in `src/components/TaskTable.jsx` around lines 160-180:

**Before (broken):**
```javascript
// Create the repository using the API endpoint              const createResponse = await fetch("/api/github-create-repo", {
```

**After (fixed):**
```javascript
// Create the repository using the API endpoint
try {
  const createResponse = await fetch("/api/github-create-repo", {
```

## Next Steps
1. **Refresh your browser** - The development server should now be able to load the TaskTable.jsx component without errors
2. **If the server is still having issues**, restart it by:
   - Stopping the current dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   - Running `npm run dev` again

## Verification
All syntax errors have been resolved. The component should now load properly in the Vite development environment.

The repository creation functionality should now work correctly with the authentication fixes previously implemented.
